# Literate Calculation Exercise

Using RStudio and RMarkdown, write a brief report to answer one of the following questions (or make up your own question). Include a title, summary, introduction, body and conclusion, though you do not need to subtitle each section. You must perform some calculations to arrive at an answer. Show your data and code as well as the calculated results, cite your data sources, and discuss any assumptions you make. Format the results in PDF, and do not exceed one page in length. Use at least one code block, and use inline R code at least once.

Please don't spend more than an hour or so on this assignment. This is supposed to be a confidence-building exercise to convince you that you can do useful, documented analysis with the skills you have already learned. If it does not have that effect, or if it convinces you of anything else, let me know.
